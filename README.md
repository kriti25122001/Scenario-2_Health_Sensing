# 🛌 Scenario 2 – Health Sensing (DeepMedico™ Project)

This repository contains the solution to **Scenario 2 – Health Sensing [25 Marks]**, a healthcare data science assignment from DeepMedico™. The goal is to detect breathing irregularities (Apnea, Hypopnea) during sleep using multi-modal physiological data collected over 8-hour sessions from 5 participants.

## 🧠 Project Overview

### Objective:
Detect **breathing disorders during sleep** using physiological time-series data and build deep learning models to classify them accurately.

### Dataset Provided:
- **Signals:**
  - Nasal Airflow (32 Hz)
  - Thoracic Movement (32 Hz)
  - SpO₂ (Oxygen Saturation, 4 Hz)
- **Annotations:**
  - Flow Events (Apnea, Hypopnea)
  - Sleep Profile (Sleep Stage Labels: Wake, REM, N1, N2, N3)

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. 📊 Visualization (3 Marks)
- Visualized all signals across the 8-hour session.
- Overlaid annotated breathing events (Apnea, Hypopnea).
- Exported participant-wise plots in PDF format inside `Visualization/`.

### 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning (4 Marks)
- Applied band-pass filtering to remove high-frequency noise.
- Preserved the breathing frequency range (0.17 Hz – 0.4 Hz).

### 3. 🧱 Dataset Creation (8 Marks)
- Split cleaned signals into **30-second windows** with **50% overlap**.
- Assigned labels: `Obstructive Apnea`, `Hypopnea`, or `Normal`.
- Created a machine learning-ready dataset.

### 4. 🤖 Modeling (10 Marks)
- Trained models using:
  - **1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
  - **1D Conv-LSTM**
- **Evaluation Strategy:** Leave-One-Participant-Out Cross-Validation (LOPO-CV)
- **Metrics Reported:**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Sensitivity, Specificity
  - Confusion Matrix (per fold and averaged)

### 5. 🌙 Bonus Task: Sleep Stage Classification (5 Marks)
- Used sleep stage annotations to classify 30s windows into stages like Wake, REM, N1, N2, N3.
- Reused CNN and Conv-LSTM models for this task.
- Added in `Bonus_task.ipynb`

## 🚀 How to Use

> You can explore the entire pipeline using the individual Jupyter notebooks provided.

- **To visualize signal data:**  
  Open `Dataset_preparation.ipynb` → Run visualization section.

- **To clean and window data:**  
  Use the filtering + dataset creation cells in `Dataset_preparation.ipynb`.

- **To train models for classification:**  
  Open `Modelling.ipynb` and run training + evaluation cells for both CNN and Conv-LSTM.

- **To attempt the bonus sleep stage task:**  
  Check `Bonus_task.ipynb`.

## 📌 Notes

- `IITG_assignment_2.ipynb` contains the entire workflow in one file and serves as a backup or consolidated version.
- Plots generated during visualization are exported to the `Visualization/` folder in PDF format as required.

---

## 📅 Future Improvements

- Add automated `vis.py` and `create_dataset.py` scripts for CLI usage.
- Integrate a dashboard for better visual analysis.
- Implement sleep stage classification with a Transformer-based model.
